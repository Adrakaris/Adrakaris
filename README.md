## Ziida Kanai 🐉

This is Yijun Hu. I do computer science at the University of Warwick.

I'm comfortable with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS, with some *basic* JavaScript. I can also generally manage C#, but haven't really found any projects I want to do using it. I've also done a bit of Haskell and C. 

Here is my corner of GitHub.

日日采莲去，洲张多暮归。  
弄篙莫溅水，畏湿红莲衣。
